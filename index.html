					<h3>MAYDAY PARADE LYRICS.</h3>
					<p>By the time I was your age I'd give everyting, To fall in love trully was all i could think, That's when I met your mother the girl of my dreams, the most beautiful woman that I've ever seen
					She said boy can I tell you a wonderful thing, I can't help but notice you're staring at me. To young to notice and to dumb to care, love was a story that couldn't compare.
					Now son Im only telling you this because life can do terrible things. Slow so slow, I fell through the wreckage, on my knees, so dont fall in love if there's to much to lose.
					Please don't walk away and please tell me you'll stay. woah! stay! woah! Use me as you will, pull my strings just for a thrill, and I know I'll be okay, but my skies are turning gray.
